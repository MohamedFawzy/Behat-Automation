Feature: About us content
  In order to use the facebook website
  As anonymous user
  I need to see the about us header, navigation and content


Scenario:
  Given I have a web browser
  When  I load the about us
  Then  I should see "The Facebook Page celebrates how our friends inspire us, support us, and help us discover the world when we connect."
